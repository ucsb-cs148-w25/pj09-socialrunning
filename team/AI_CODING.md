Adil Ahmed - I switched to Cursor IDE and I have been using it to debug issues very fast. 
Instead of switching into GPT, Cursor already has my files and understands the context behind my code.
It is especially good for backend functions or package usage. I think it sometimes get confused on what files to use though.


Piyush Jadhav - For my experiment, I used ChatGPT to help me in writing better UI. One of the pages that I mainly worked on was the page where users select their cardio zone and duration, so I used AI to try to make the UI of it better. It was able to produce a visually appealing dropdown and a nice box for the duration and keeping it all centered. I think using ChatGPT was a good resource for UI because it does not really require a lot of files and all you need to do is tell it what you want the design to look like, making it efficient. The slight drawback was that it sometimes requires very clear instructions and telling it multiple times on what you want. In order for it to fully work the way I wanted it to work, I had to explain my full thought process and then it would get something wrong, so I would have to reiterate what I wanted sometimes.
