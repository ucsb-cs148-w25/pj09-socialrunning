Adil Ahmed - I switched to Cursor IDE and I have been using it to debug issues very fast. 
Instead of switching into GPT, Cursor already has my files and understands the context behind my code.
It is especially good for backend functions or package usage. I think it sometimes get confused on what files to use though.


Piyush Jadhav - For my experiment, I used ChatGPT to help me in writing better UI. One of the pages that I mainly worked on was the page where users select their cardio zone and duration, so I used AI to try to make the UI of it better. It was able to produce a visually appealing dropdown and a nice box for the duration and keeping it all centered. I think using ChatGPT was a good resource for UI because it does not really require a lot of files and all you need to do is tell it what you want the design to look like, making it efficient. The slight drawback was that it sometimes requires very clear instructions and telling it multiple times on what you want. In order for it to fully work the way I wanted it to work, I had to explain my full thought process and then it would get something wrong, so I would have to reiterate what I wanted sometimes. 

Nilay Kundu - For my AI experiment, I used both ChatGPT and Claude to for better scalability ideas for the app. More specifically, I want to address an issue where the IP Address has to be manually entered each time networks are switched. I asked both LLMs for possible solutions and a few of their ideas were: use a local network discovery approach (mDNS, react-native-zeroconf), use a static domain name, and use an environemental variable. When given a file to add the implementation of react-native-zeroconf, ChatGPT was able to understand the context of what the file is doing at each step and write code for the automatic ip address retrieval. However, the implementation caused an error, indicating that the new code does not seamlessly integrate with the other components on the page properly.

Ria Sinha - For my coding with AI experiment, I used ChatGPT to generate optimal unit tests for my code. I wanted to see how Chat GPT's responses would compare and contrast with my own strategies for unit testing. For my portion of the unit testing, I thought that it would be most optimal to test edge cases for the user inputs to ensure that it would correctly identify invalid inputs. I used the Jest library to test our frontend. When I asked Chat GPT for unit test ideas it recommended to use Jest & React Testing Library for unit and UI tests, while Appium/Detox could be used for mobile end-to-end automation. It also recommended using PyTest/JUnit to ensure backend API reliability.
