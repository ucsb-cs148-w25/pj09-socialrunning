Adil Ahmed - I switched to Cursor IDE and I have been using it to debug issues very fast. 
Instead of switching into GPT, Cursor already has my files and understands the context behind my code.
It is especially good for backend functions or package usage. I think it sometimes get confused on what files to use though.
