# User Feedback Implementation Plan

## 1. Decisions Based on USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md  
After reviewing the feedback we received, our team has identified how to enhance our app to be more user friendly. One of the most requested features was better playlist customization, particularly with genre selection. Many users expressed that while the BPM-based playlist generation is helpful, they would prefer to have more control over the type of music that gets selected. To address this, we have decided to incorporate an additional user input text field where users can describe their running mood or environment (e.g., "gloomy day jog"), and we will fine-tune the playlist selection to recommend songs that match that vibe.   

## **2. Additional Decisions Based on Feedback**  
- **Genre Selection Enhancement (Section 2 & 5):** We will introduce a genre-filtering system based on user mood inputs to improve playlist relevance.  
- **Bug Fixes (Section 3):**  
  - Fix back button navigation issues.  
  - Debug authentication errors with login/signup.  
- **Playlist History (Section 3 & 5):** We will also play around with a feature where the users can reload previously generated playlists for easy access. This will enhance our current feature that displays the new playlist directly in the Spotify app.
