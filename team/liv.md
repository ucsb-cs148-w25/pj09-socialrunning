# Hi, I'm Liv!

I'm a senior CS student in my last quarter at UCSB. After graduation, I'll be working as a Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) in Austin.

This quarter, I'm trying out the triathlon team at UCSB and really loving it! In my free time, I enjoy anything active and outdoors, like:
- Hiking
- Running
- Playing spikeball
- Going to the beach

## Project Ideas

For our project, I hope we can:
- Recommend songs tailored to specific running zones.
- Help users customize their playlists based on their resting heart rate.

I'm excited to explore this idea and see what we can build together! I love running to music and this is something I would want to use once we implement it.
