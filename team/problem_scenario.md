Sarah is a passionate runner who enjoys listening to music during her workouts. She has a carefully curated playlist, but often finds that the rhythm of the songs doesnâ€™t match her pace or mood during her runs. This discrepancy leaves her feeling out of sync, frustrated, and unable to fully immerse herself in her workout. She wishes there was a way to make the music align with her running tempo and energy levels to create a more enjoyable and motivating experience.
