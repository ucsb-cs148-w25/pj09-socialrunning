## Retro Assessment (to do at END of retro)

* Format: Used the start/stop/continue format for this retro. Each member comes up with actions/habits to start, stop, continue doing, respectively (in slack channel). All members voted on items they deemed imporant and top items were discussed to determine future steps. 
* Reflection: Effective at bringing out ideas to improve productivity for all members. Slow at first, but made steady progress once everyone was focused.
* Advice for future retros: Being assertive helps to lead the conversation when others are quiet. Additionally, may be useful to ask members directly to encourage quiter members.

## Experiment/Change (to do at END of retro)
* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?
