# Date of Retrospective: 01/27/25

* Led by: Liv Jonokuchi
* Present: Liv, Adil, Aneesh, Ron, Nilay, Piyush, Ria
* Absent: none

## Action item 1

* Goal: start working on Kanban issues for MVP
* Change/experiment: each member writes a message in the Slack for when they are planning to work on their assigned tasks. Reply to the message when working on the task.
* Measurement: everyone has 2 PRs by this week

## Action item 2

* Goal: start being more thorough in daily scrums 
* Change/experiment: provide more details about personal tasks/obstacles and create plans to achieve goal
* Measurement: daily documentation on scrum, each member has at least 2 sentences for their current situation

## Retro Assessment

* Format: We used the start/stop/continue format for this retro. Each member comes up with actions/habits to start, stop, continue doing, respectively (in Slack channel). All members voted on items they deemed important and top items were discussed to determine future steps. 
* Reflection: Effective at bringing out ideas to improve productivity for all members. Slow at first, but made steady progress once everyone was focused.
* Advice for future retros: Being assertive helps to lead the conversation when others are quiet. Additionally, may be useful to ask members directly to encourage quiter members.

## Experiment/Change 
* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment:
  * (Taken from our Slack page notes): We found some common themes during retro on 1/27: making more specific sub-issues (splitting up work) on the Kanban board to keep organized, notifying the group and teaching team if missing, wanting to be more clear about what weâ€™re doing and working on (more thorough daily scrums).
  
Goal 1: everyone has to get coding for MVP
Measured by: everyone should have 2 PRs by end of week
Goal 2: everyone set aside a specific time to work on their part of the MVP
Measured by: everyone send when they plan to work on it in the Slack, and then reply to your message in the Slack when you actually do it (to track progress)
Goal 3: more thorough daily scrums really checking in with each other, asking questions
Measured by: our md files having at least a sentence or two per person with a thorough update and group consensus of feeling in the loop

* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?) &   
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?:

  Goal 1:
  It did move the needle but not everyone will necessarily have 2 PRs by midnight tonight. We will not keep this going forward as we realized that the exact number of 2 PRs is a bit arbitrary. We all feel that we are contributing better and don't need this.
  Goal 2:
  Yes, it did help move the needle. We will keep up this practice in the future as it has helped us all stay accountable. Some members feel that the process of going back to their message was too cumbersome so we will scratch that part in the future. But we will keep the change in that we will send in the Slack when we plan to work on our parts.
  Goal 3:
  Yes, we all felt more in the loop with what was happening and what everyone was working on. We will continue the check-ins but realized that actually typing everything was a bit tedious. So we will keep up the daily scrums but aren't going to require having any exact number of sentences etc.
