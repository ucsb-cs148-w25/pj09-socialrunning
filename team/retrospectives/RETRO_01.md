## Action item 1

## Action item 2

* Change/experiment: provide more details about personal tasks/obstacles and create plans to achieve goal
* Measurement: daily documentation on scrum, each member has at least 2 sentences for their current situation

## Retro Assessment

* Format: Used the start/stop/continue format for this retro. Each member comes up with actions/habits to start, stop, continue doing, respectively (in slack channel). All members voted on items they deemed imporant and top items were discussed to determine future steps. 
* Reflection: Effective at bringing out ideas to improve productivity for all members. Slow at first, but made steady progress once everyone was focused.
* Advice for future retros: Being assertive helps to lead the conversation when others are quiet. Additionally, may be useful to ask members directly to encourage quiter members.

## Experiment/Change 
* A brief description of what constitutes your change/experiment
* A brief assessment of how its results (did it improve things? move the needle at all?)
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?

* (Taken from Slack page notes): Common themes during retro on 1/27: making more specific sub-issues (splitting up work) on kanban board to keep organized, notifying group and teaching team if missing, want to be more clear about what weâ€™re doing and working on (more thorough daily scrums)
Goal 1: everyone has to get coding for MVP
Measured by: everyone should have 2 PRs by end of week
Goal 2: everyone set aside a specific time to work on their part of the MVP
Measured by: everyone send when they plan to work on it in the Slack, and then reply to your message in the Slack when you actually do it (to track progress)
Goal 3: more thorough daily scrums really checking in with each other, asking questions
Measured by: our md files having at least a sentence or two per person with a thorough update and group consensus of feeling in the loop
