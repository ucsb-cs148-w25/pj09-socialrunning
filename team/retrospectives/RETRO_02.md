* Absent: none

## Action item 1

* Goal: Push more code regarding the spotify functionality and getting better playlists. Also, we need to fix the sign in page for non-spotify users. 
* Change/experiment: Let us all try to make at least 1 PR a week. 
* Measurement: We can see if we have at least 1 PR a week.

## Action item 2

* Goal: Identifying and pointing out bugs as we find them
* Change/experiment: When a team member finds a bug or an issue originating from a new feature or that has already existed, they should add this bug to the Kanban board with a "BUG" header and a priority/importance number (1-5). Additionally, it would be helpful to describe the bug in detail and how to reproduce it, and since when the team member was aware the bug had been around. In this way, teammates will be more conscious of which bugs need fixing as priority and how to recreate them.
* Measurement: We measure effectiveness based on the amount of issues moved to be done, and the proportion of them that are labeled as bugs. The more tasks we finish, the better our product will be, and if a significant number of them are bugs, this is a good sign because it means that we are fixing the broken parts of our codebase and the functionality will be more coherent.

## Retro Assessment (to do at END of retro)

* We used a standup format for the retro process. Each of us rather than typing out the start/stop/continue verbalized what has been working and what needs improvement, and we came to a consensus as a group on the two most important action items moving forward.
* This process went really well---to be honest, I (Ron) prefer it over the traditional approach. When we communicate we can merge and actively modify ideas, and the conversation flows much more. This is a quick way to lead a retro and is arguably more efficient than the typed-out approach.
* I would encourage future retro leaders to be positive and encouraging of everyone to participate and share their opinion. The more inclusive and friendly the environment, the better critique will be given and the freer people will feel speaking their mind.

## Experiment/Change 

* Our experiment entails two things: we will introduce a BUG category for issues to separate them from new features and will be more descriptive with our issue labeling. In general, we want our tasks to be well-defined and our Kanban board to be more populated.
* Results?
* Keep the change?
