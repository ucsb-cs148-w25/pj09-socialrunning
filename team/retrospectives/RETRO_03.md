## Action item 2

* Change/experiment: provide more details about personal tasks/obstacles and create plans to achieve goal
* Measurement: daily documentation on scrum, each member has at least 2 sentences for their current situation

## Retro Outcomes
* We used start/stop/continue format for this retro. Each member comes up with actions/habits to start, stop, continue doing, respectively (in Slack channel). All members voted on items they deemed important and top items were discussed to determine future steps. We found that this was a helpful strategy to ensure that all team members could contribute to the retro equally.



## Report
* Successes: Thourough daily scrums kept our project moving forward and made it easy to identify roadblocks or bugs. Good team communication in terms of addressing issues that came up such as with limitations with the Spotify API. Divided up the work well into subteams to ensure that different features and functionalities of the app could be developed simultaneously.
* Goals: A goal for us is to check our pull requests more thoroughly instead of merging it if there are no conflicts or merging it without getting anyone to look at the request. Additionally, we think communicating better about the purpose behind some of the code we build would be better for our team.
* a commitment: We will set time throughout the week to do pair programming and ensure that the app is deployed well ahead of time so that we are not stressing about it last minute.
