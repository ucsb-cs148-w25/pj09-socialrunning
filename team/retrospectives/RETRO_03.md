## Retro Outcomes
* We used start/stop/continue format for this retro. Each member comes up with actions/habits to start, stop, continue doing, respectively (in Slack channel). All members voted on items they deemed important and top items were discussed to determine future steps. We found that this was a helpful strategy to ensure that all team members could contribute to the retro equally.

## Report
* Successes: Thourough daily scrums kept our project moving forward and made it easy to identify roadblocks or bugs. Good team communication in terms of addressing issues that came up such as with limitations with the Spotify API. Divided up the work well into subteams to ensure that different features and functionalities of the app could be developed simultaneously.
