# Date of Retrospective: 03/07/25

* Led by: Ria Sinha
* Present: Piyush, Aneesh, Nilay, Ron, Liv, Adil

## Action item 1

* Goal: start finishing up PRs and working on final presentation
* Change/experiment: team members work together to synthesize all parts into a clear presentation
* Measurement: completed final presentation

## Retro Outcomes
* We used start/stop/continue format for this retro. Each member comes up with actions/habits to start, stop, continue doing, respectively (in Slack channel). All members voted on items they deemed important and top items were discussed to determine future steps. We found that this was a helpful strategy to ensure that all team members could contribute to the retro equally.

## Report
* Successes: Thourough daily scrums kept our project moving forward and made it easy to identify roadblocks or bugs. Good team communication in terms of addressing issues that came up such as with limitations with the Spotify API. Divided up the work well into subteams to ensure that different features and functionalities of the app could be developed simultaneously.
* Goals: A goal for us is to check our pull requests more thoroughly instead of merging it if there are no conflicts or merging it without getting anyone to look at the request. Additionally, we think communicating better about the purpose behind some of the code we build would be better for our team.
* a commitment: We will set time throughout the week to do pair programming and ensure that the app is deployed well ahead of time so that we are not stressing about it last minute.

# Optional
During this retro, we also had a discussion about how we can work towards successfully carrying out our final presentation in the upcoming weeks. We want to prioritize highlighting the product purpose and unique features. We also want to focus on communicating how we implemented our idea in both the frontend and backend such that non technical audiences can still understand our project. We will also finetune our demo so that it properly explains the purpose and features especially highlighting how the app would benefit our intended user audience.
