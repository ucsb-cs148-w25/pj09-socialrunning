## Brief description of me

My name is Ron, I'm BS/MS student in the CS Department interested in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

## Ideas for socialrunning project

- Focus more on compression/lengthening algorithm, as this changes pitch (maintaining frequency of pitch requires a complex algorithm)

- Makes more sense as mobile (iOS) project: personally am more comfortable with web apps, but I think iOS and React Native makes more sense given the use case

- Spotify-adjacent UI, Home page/"Playlists" tab to contain playlists corresponding to specific BPM and name of playlist, "Editor" tab to find/adjust songs, optionally "Explore" page to look at friends' playlists and posts
