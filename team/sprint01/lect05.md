Scribed Discussion:

We conducted our first sprint's retro. Common themes during retro on 1/27: making more specific sub-issues (splitting up work) on kanban board to keep organized, notifying group and teaching team if missing, want to be more clear about what weâ€™re doing and working on (more thorough daily scrums).

We created goals based on the retro. We have now splitup into subteams to work on backend algorithm, front end screens, and refining login.
