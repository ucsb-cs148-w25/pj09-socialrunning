Facing an issue with the Spotify API where we are unable to access the music data (tempo, beat, etc.) - endpoints deprecated. 


Adil: Worked on song algorithm backend. Figuring out issues with Spotify API (blocker). -> Planning to work with Aneesh and Ria with backend and using Kaggle project. 

Aneesh: Worked on the CreatePlaylist frontend page. -> Planning to help with Adil and Ria with backend and using Kaggle project. 

Ron: Added spotify integration and improved UX for login page. Will work on localhost issue on webapp (working fine on mobile) and open to helping other teammates with their blockers. 

Olivia: Worked on sign up page and got it to work functionally. Now planning to work on updating the UI to fit with Ron's edits to the login page.

Nilay: Worked on the CreatePlaylist frontend page. Planning to connect that page to the frontend with Piyush.

-> NOTE: found solution to blocker - will use a Kaggle project that used the endpoints we wanted before they became deprecated: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priyamchoksi/spotify-dataset-114k-songs
